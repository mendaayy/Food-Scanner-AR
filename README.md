# Food Scanner
PWA: https://i488547.hera.fhict.nl/cookly/ (Works only on mobile)

## Introduction 

Get recipes based on food recognition technology. First, take a photo of your ingredients (could be one or multiple) in one frame and it will display the food names. You can confirm wether these are correct or not. After confirmation, it will generate the recipes based on the scanned ingredients.

## Background

**Problem Statement**

The primary issue identified is that students often end up wasting leftover ingredients from cooked meals or unused components due to a lack of knowledge regarding how to make the best use of them. Factors contributing to this problem include the availability of goods in multipacks and a limited understanding of creative cooking techniques. As a result, valuable food resources are discarded, leading to unnecessary waste and environmental implications.

**Solution Proposal**

To combat this problem, the proposed solution is the development of a mobile application that assists students in effectively utilizing leftover ingredients to create meals. The app will leverage advanced technologies such as ingredient scanning to generate recipe suggestions, maximizing the use of the existing items and minimizing food waste.

**Process**

This project took 1 month from doing UX research to development of the app. Throughout the whole process, I followed the Design Thinking approach: the [Design Kit](https://www.designkit.org/). For each phase of the project, I used relevant research methods to gather and define the target audience and their needs. In the end, I followed an iterative design process to refine the prototype as much as possible and needed until the deadline.

## Front-end Development 

**My contribution**

I coded the scanning part and the food confirmation using the [Logmeal API](https://logmeal.es/). After I was done with coding that functionality and the UI, I created the link between the food confirmation and generating recipe based on the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api). In the end, I made the finishing touches and touched up the UI for instance, displaying the foodnames in the recipe page etc.

**Tools & Technology

- Food recognition through Logmeal API 
- Spoonacular API
- Camera
- JS ES6+
- HTML & CSS
